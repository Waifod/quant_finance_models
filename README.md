# Quant Finance Models

Project containing the implementations of quantitative finance models.

Models to be implemented:
- Black-Scholes
- CAPM
- VaR (Value at Risk)
- Modern Portfolio Theory

For the first three we plan to create two implementations, one classical 
and the other one using Monte-Carlo simulations.
